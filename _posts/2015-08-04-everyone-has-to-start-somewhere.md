Hello! Welcome to my blog, I'm glad you're here. I recently changed my career, and my life, by teaching myself to code. I was able to transition from a stagnating career in finance to landing a job as a front end developer at an awesome company in less than 15 months. It wasn't easy, and I worked really hard to achieve my goals, but it's absolutely possible if you're willing to work for it.

I thought it would be a good idea to start writing about my experience, for several reasons. First of all, it's my hope that others might find hope and inspiration as they progress in their own individual journeys. I know I always found it encouraging when I read about other people's success stories. It helped me continue to believe that achieving my goals was possible.

I've also heard many times, from people whom I respect, that one of the most effective ways to truly learn a subject is to write about it. You may not realize that you don't fully understand a topic until you try to explain or teach it to someone else. So, by writing about what I'm learning, I hope to further my own understanding and knowledge.

Lastly, I find that writing helps me think more clearly. By putting my thoughts down on paper, I am able to get them out of my head. I have found that this allows me to free up some brain power to more easily analyze a topic or problem. This also helps to prevent information overload.

And so it begins, this is my first post. I'm glad you're here, I hope you stick around, and I hope you find something useful or enlightening in the things I have to say. Stay tuned, there's more to come.
