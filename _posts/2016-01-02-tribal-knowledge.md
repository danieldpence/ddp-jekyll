Going into a new position, and a new career, I had prepared myself with the skill set that I thought would prepare me to hit the ground running from day one. I had built up my technical chops to a point where I felt I could contribute. I was confident in my ability to seek out answers to questions I would have, and my soft skills were already in a great place from my previous business experience. For the most part, I would say I was fairly well prepared. However, there was one thing I hadn't considered that I would need to keep an open ear for - _tribal knowledge_.

Tribal knowledge is often referred to as any 'undocumented information that is not commonly known by others within a organization'. It is context. It is history. It is the seemingly-insignificant details and information assumed to be commonly known by the organization as a whole. You will not find it in a wiki, and you will not hear about it during orientation. But you _will_ begin to see its gravity all around you as you immerse yourself in your organization and your work.

As developers, and an industry as a whole, I would say we do a fairly good job of documenting our work. Some would argue that well-written code is in itself, self-documenting. However, it's easy to overlook the little things and minor details in the process of documenting the larger project.

As a newbie, it's important to keep your ears open in an effort to absorb as much context as possible. Always be asking questions. Next time you have to ask how to do something, make sure you ask for an explanation of why that certain thing is done that way and what the history is behind it.
