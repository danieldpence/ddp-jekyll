Well, it's official. I've made it through my first 90 days as 'professional' developer. I thought I would spend a few minutes reflecting on my experience so far.

#### My Expectations vs Reality
When I think back on how I felt going into this career transition, I recall having mixed feelings. On one hand, I was extremely excited to be moving into a career that I felt I could self-identify, and that offered tons of upward-mobility potential. And on the other hand, despite how much time and energy I'd put into learning and developing the skills necessary for a career in web development, I was struggling to fight off some serious imposter syndrome.

I've been very fortunate to have joined a team of developers who are not only highly skilled, but are passionate about mentoring and helping younger developers grow. While my transition into this career hasn't felt incredibly overwhelming, I have definitely had my moments of uncertainty, and it's been a major blessing to have teammates who understand that and are willing to jump in and help as a moment's notice. My self-confidence has increased dramatically due to the fact that I work with such a supportive team.
