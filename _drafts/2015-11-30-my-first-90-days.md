Well, it's official. I've made it through my first 90 days as 'professional' developer. I thought I would spend a few minutes reflecting on my experience so far.

#### My Expectations vs Reality
When I think back on how I felt going into this career transition, I recall having mixed feelings. On one hand, I was extremely excited to be moving into a career that I felt I could self-identify with, and that offered tons of upward-mobility potential. And on the other hand, despite how much time and energy I'd put into learning and developing the skills necessary for a career in web development, I was struggling to fight off some serious imposter syndrome.

I've been very fortunate to have joined a team of developers who are not only highly skilled, but are passionate about mentoring and encouraging younger developers. While my transition into this career hasn't felt incredibly overwhelming, I have definitely had my moments of uncertainty, and it's been a major blessing to have team mates who understand that and are willing to jump in and help as a moment's notice. My self-confidence has increased dramatically due to the fact that I work with such a supportive team.

To be frank, the performance expectations that my leaders set for me during my initial 90 days were fairly low. That's not to say they didn't expect me to perform, but they knew that my development experience was minimal and so they didn't expect me to perform at the level of someone with years of experience. They encouraged me to spend those first three months learning as much as I could from the team and not focus so much on how many lines of code I was writing. But, I'm not the type of person that sits back and waits until I'm asked to do things, so I certainly went in with the attitude of trying to exceed every expectation that was set for me.

#### Projects I've Worked On
Most of the projects and tickets that I've worked on during my initial 90 days have been bug fixes and feature enhancements. The most fun project I took on was converting a static landing page from a legacy Cold Fusion app over to Ruby on Rails. That project was fun because I was able to flex my front-end muscle.

Arguably the most complicated project I worked on was enhancing the search feature in one of our applications that previously only had a single text field search that used Solr on the backend. The requirements of this particular project definitely taught me a lot about the entire stack of our application.
