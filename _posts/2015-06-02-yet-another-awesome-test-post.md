One of the issues that a lot of self-taught, or young, developers deal with is accurately assessing their skills set. The problem is, most of us have no context - we haven't had enough experience working with other developers to fully understand how advanced (or not) our skill set is. We simply do not have anything or anyone with which to compare ourselves. How do you measure something without a yard stick?

While there are a variety of ways that we can tackle this problem, I thought it might be useful to provide an honest assessment of where I believe my skill set is right now, as I'm preparing to start my first job as a web developer. My hope is that I can provide a 'baseline' of sorts to not only help other people, but to look back on for my own personal benefit.

I'm definitely not an _expert_ by any stretch of the imagination, and I'm very much aware that my journey towards becoming a professional web developer has really just begun, but I think this is a pretty good summary of the technologies, tools, and concepts I am confident I have _at least_ a working knowledge of:

#### HTML - The "Content" Layer
* HTML provides the bare bones 'structure' of a web document.
* Knowledge of semantic meaning of most commonly used HTML5 elements.
* Knowledge and ability to hand code clean markup.
* HTML forms, lists, tables, links, images, etc.
* Understanding of appropriate uses of document meta data tags.
* Knowledge of how to load external resources (stylesheets, scripts, etc.), and where to place those tags in the document struture.
* Basic level of knowledge around accessibility considerations.
* There's probably more to add to this list...?

#### CSS - The "Presentation" Layer
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets, specify and manipulate the visual presentation of elements rendered in a HTML document.
* Ability to recreate a Photoshop (or simliar) design in the browser.
* Understanding of key concepts: specificity, inheritance, the box model, padding vs margin, various layout techniques, etc.
* Difference between an ID and a class, and when/when not to use each.
* Familiarity and beginner-level experience with cross-browser compatibility testing.
* Understanding of what a CSS-reset is why you would want to use one.
* Understanding and experience with responsive design and using media queries to adapt content to a user's device.
* Working knowledge of CSS animations, transforms, and transitions.
* Again, I probably know/have used more than what I've listed here...

#### JavaScript - The "Interaction" Layer
* Firm understanding of the "basics" of the language (grammar, data types, control flow, loops and iteration, anonymous vs named functions, expressions and operators, arrays, objects, etc).
* Knowledge of the Document Object Model and experience with traversing and manipulating it.
* Understanding of "this" keyword.
* Understanding of lexical scoping, closures (IIFE), and hoisting.
* Understanding of higher-order functions/callback functions.
* Knowledge and understanding of the concept of Prototype and Prototype-based inheritance.
* Familiarity with various methods of creating objects and arrays (literals, constructors, etc).
* Familiarity with commonly used design patterns.

#### Ruby & Ruby On Rails
* Working knowledge of the core Ruby language.
* Firm understanding of MVC application architecture and responsibilities of each component.
* Ability to design, plan, and build a Rails application from the ground up.
* Experiencing depoloying an application to Heroku.

#### Other Frameworks and Libraries
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Skeleton
* D3
* Highcharts, Chartist, ChartJS, and other Javascript charting Libraries

#### Tools / Other Languages
* CSS Pre-processor - SASS
* GIT & Version Control
* Build tools - Grunt, Gulp
* NodeJS, NPM
* Command Line
* Various text editors (Atom is my current favorite)
* SQL
