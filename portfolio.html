                    <p>Codeitnotes...like 'lotus notes'...get it? Ok, so that's pretty lame, but this is a Rails application that's simliar to Pinterest, or a bookmarking site. After creating an account, Users can create, update, or delete "notes". Users can add a title, description, image, and link to the external resource for the note. Notes can also be "tagged" and categorized however the user sees fit.</p>

                    <p>While there are several enhancements I would like to make in the future, this project was fun to build from nothing, all the way to functional application. This is the first project that I've really dug into using the Devise gem for user authentication, and found it to be fairly easy to setup and understand. As the creators of Devise themselves advise, if you've never rolled your own user authentication, you probably should do so before you jump into something like Devise.</p>

                    <h3>danielpence.com v1.0</h3>
                    <p>This was the very first version of my personal website. It was a simple, single-page static site that was meant to introduce myself to potential employers. The page had a section with a quick introduction section about who I am, followed by a portfolio section showcasing some of the work I had done up to that point.</p>

                    <p>I also had a contact form that used a pretty cool service called Formspree to handle the submission of the message. Basically, you submit the form messages to Formspree's servers, and they simply forward those messages to your email inbox. It was really simple to setup and works like a charm. No need to overcomplicate things, right?</p>

                    <p>I probably spent a whole lot more time working on this initial version of my site than I needed to, but I wanted it to really showcase my skill level and potential for growth. The only thing I wish I had implemented sooner was a blog of some sort. There's been so many moments that I've thought, "hey, that would make a great blog post", yet I had no blog to publish to. Thus my motivation for creating the current version of my website!</p>
