        <p>My name is <strong>Daniel Pence</strong>, and I'm a web developer from Nashville, TN. In early 2014, I set out on a mission to change my career, and my life, by teaching myself to code. It wasn't easy, but I was able to go from a stagnating job in finance to launching a new career as an associate front end web developer with an awesome company whose mission I'm pumped about getting behind. I started this blog to document where I've been, what I'm learning, and hopefully inspire and encourage others who are trying to do the same.</p>

        <p>When I'm not writing code, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son, outdoor adventures, cooking, writing, reading, and prentending to be a handyman around the house.</p>

        <p>I earned my Bachelor of Business Administration, with a focus on entrepreneurship and small business, at Middle Tennessee State University in 2008. I also earned an Associate of Science in Records Arts from Full Sail University in 2004.</p>
