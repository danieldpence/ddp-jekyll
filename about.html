            <p>My name is <strong>Daniel Pence</strong>, and I'm a web developer from Nashville, TN. I'm curenty seeking opportunities to build awesome things with awesome people. I have a background in entrepreneurship and finance, but my passion is building web applications. While my skillset is mostly geared towards the front-end, I'm certainly not afraid to get my hands dirty on the back end.</p>

            <p>When I'm not writing code, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son, outdoor adventures, traveling, reading, and keeping up with the latest trends in web development. I'm also passionate about music and a lifelong musician.</p>

            <p>I earned my Bachelor of Business Administration, with a focus on entrepreneurship and small business, at Middle Tennessee State University in 2008. I also earned an Associate of Science in Records Arts from Full Sail University in 2004. As the saying goes, "If at first you do not succeed, try, try again."</p>
