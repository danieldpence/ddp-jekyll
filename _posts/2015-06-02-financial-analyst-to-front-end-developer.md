It was the spring of 2014. My wife and I had just welcomed our first son to the world, and despite total sleep depravity, the 2 a.m. feedings and seemingly constant diaper changes, it was the most incredible time in my life so far. But, like many new Dads, I was beginning to feel the weight of a responsibility that far surpassed any I had ever known. I had become responsible for the well-being of another human being who physically could not take care of himself.

When I wasn't changing diapers, I was going on my sixth year working as a **Financial Analyst** at a local start up. As a company, we were trying to change the way advertisers offered discounts to consumers by integrating with their bank cards. A novel idea, yes, but one whose business model was fundamentally flawed, which ultimately led to a severe lack of confidence from investors and employees alike.

I learned a ton about business and entrepreneurship during those six years, and for the most part, I really enjoyed what I did and was proud of what we were doing. Being so close to the financial operations and executive leadership of the company, I was privy to a lot of strategic discussions and confidential information. At one point I was convinced that we were going to be the next Groupon (see my eyes roll?). Needless to say, that didn't pan out.

My job as Financial Analyst was never something I set out to do. In all honestly, it just kind of happened as a natural internal transition from one role to another as the needs of the company changed. I wanted to be a part of the team, and I thought I could do what need to be done, and so I jumped on the opportunity. And I gave it my all for a long time...

But as time went on and the company took fewer and fewer steps towards financial sustainability, I began to burn out. I was tired of staring at spreadsheets all day long. My work had become mundane and un-challenging. **Monday had become a curse word**. I had virtually zero accountability. Sure, I had a "manager", but there was no clear career path, goals, or growth plan. And where was my incentive? I was paid the same regardless of the quality of my work, so long as it got done. This was my Office Space moment.

Something had to change. I knew I wasn't using my skills and talents to their full potential. I knew I wasn't growing, in fact, I was floundering. More importantly, I now had a tiny human being at home to take care of, who one day will ask me, **"Dad, why do you do what you do for a living?"**. I wanted to be able to answer that question with confidence and passion. I wanted to be able to inspire him to reach his full potential one day, not just working for a paycheck, but working in his unique skills, talents, and passions.

If there is one thing I have learned through this whole process, it's this: **you'll never change your circumstances if you aren't willing to try something new**. I knew there was little runway left in my current professional situation. I knew I needed to either find a new **J-O-B** or create a new _career_.

After throwing around several ideas in my head, I saw an advertisement for a web-based learning platform called [Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com) that piqued my interest. I knew web developers were in demand, and I knew it could be a relatively lucrative career, so I thought it was worth looking into a little further. Then, I briefly recalled a conversation with a former coworker who had mentioned in passing that he had used it to learn how to build websites a couple years ago. I also saw that they had a free trial (one month at the time), and so I made a deal with myself: I'll do the free trial. If I stick with this for the whole month and am still as interested, then I might be on to something.

As it turns out, I _was_ on to something. In fact, I think it's fair to say that I soon became absorbed in learning as much as I possibly could about web development. It was so fun! I could type some stuff into a text editor and see it come to life right before my eyes. Both the **creative and logical parts of my brain were engaged**, and it was awesome! Before long, I was writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and built my own website to showcase the projects I had been working on in order to market myself to potential employers. I continued to learn more and more, even learning Ruby on Rails. I was **totally enamored** with the possibilities that this new career field could afford me.

After nearly a year of learning as much as I possibly could in my downtime, nights, and weekends, I felt that I had accumulated a baseline skill set good enough to get me an entry level front end web development position. I could not have predicted what was in store for me. I'll save the details for another blog post, but within 15 months of beginning this journey, I was offered a full time job as a front end web developer for [Ramsey Solutions](http://www.daveramsey.com).
